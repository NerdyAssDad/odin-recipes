  <h1>Savoury Beef Stew</h1>
    <p> There are few things better during a cold winter than hearty and rich beef stew! My recipe borrows heavily from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's famous recipe, though I <strong>do</strong> disagree with a few of Kenji's conclusions and my recipe differs as a result. You can find Kenji's recipe <a href ="https://www.seriouseats.com/all-american-beef-stew-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here!</a> I highly recommend giving it a read. Kenji is a great resource for recipes and general food knowledge. This recipe can be a little labor intensive (<em>no throwing pre-packaged stew meat into a crock pot here!</em>) but it is well worth the effort. You will absolutely taste the difference that all that effort makes.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredient Notes</h2>
      <li><h3>Beef</h3>
        <p> Good beef choice is the most important and most often overlooked part of making stew. A surprising number of people just grab whatever is handy or cheapest and throw it into a pot. But this beef stew relies heavily on the beef flavor, so we need to show a little more care in our beef choice. As Kenji mentions, stay away from those pakcages of "stew meat" at the grocery store! Those are usually just the off cuts and scraps from other cuts and you can never be sure what your getting, or even that your getting the same cuts in one package.  There are a few things we're looking for when thinking about what cut of beef to use.
          <ol>
            <li>We want a strong beefy flavor</li>
            <li>We want a lot of connective tissue, tougher fat, and a lot of collagen</li>
            <li>We want large steaks or a large hunk of beef we can cut into steaks</li>
          </ol>

          Stay away from actual cuts of steak! They are too tender and the softer fat renders too quickly (which is great when your making steak!), but will result in tough chewy meat in a stew. We need tougher meat with high collagen content and plenty of fat. Bones are a bonus as they add a ton of flavor, but are not needed. We want to stick with:
          <ul>
            <li>Chuck</li>
            <li>Bone-in short rib</li>
            <li>Bohemian (bottom sirloin flap)</li>
            <li>Oxtail</li>
            <li>Second-cut brisket (The fatty end)</li>
            <li>Cross-cut shanks (like for osso buco)</li>
            </ul>

          Your final choice is going to depend on your budget and availablilty of a good butcher.This is the most important ingredient, but also the most expensive. That being said, it's worth spending extra to get good beef from a quality butcher, if you have one nearby. The difference this will make in the final product is <strong>huge</strong>. Some of the above cuts are hard to find and may have to be specially ordered, but you should be able to find a good chuck roast anywhere. Just show care when grabbing chuck roast from the grocery store. I have pretty much always been unimpressed with the chuck roasts i've gotten from any big box store. I'f you live in a more rural area, look around for some farms as well! It's pretty common for cattle ranches to sell their own beef. When we do find our beef, we want to use ,or cut, it into about 2"- 2 1/2" steaks. This will allow us to get really good browning on as much meat as possible, while keeping the amount of meat that actually gets cooked while do doing so to a minimum. We want our meat to cook in the oven, not on the stove! After browning we are going to cut the meet into 1 1/2" - 2" cubes to go into the stew</p></li>
      <li><h3>Vegetables</h3>
       <p>  We are going to seperate our veggies into two batches. Whole, or mostly whole, for flavoring the broth and nice fork size pieces to go in during the last hour or so of cooking. This allows us to get all the flavor for stewing the veggiers for a long time, while still retaining nice spoonfuls of deliciousness. We are going to brown most of our veggies, which will give us a ton of flavor, but this will effect how the veggies cook. Also, browning effectively requires the veggies to be quite dry. So veggies that hold a lot of moisture will need some special preparation if you're going to go with one. I'm only going to cover the classic options, but I've seen people use things like eggplant, zucchini, or squash in beef stew. Just keep in mind the above rules when making your decision. Generally, go for larger veggies that can be cut down. The actual veggies we can use is variable and up for debate, but here are the classics:
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Carrots</h4>
            <p> Carrots are a given with beef stew. The only point I have here is; <strong>DO NOT USE BABY CARROTS</strong>. Baby carrots are just the centers of full size carrots with the outside portions shaved away. Baby carrots produce <strong>way</strong> to much moisture to brown effectively. We will use standard large, unpeeled carrots you can find at the grocery store. It's important to get the unpeeled carrots, as the skin keeps the insides from absorbing all the moisture that gets sprayed on the produce at the grocery store.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Onion</h4>
            <p> A beef stew is not complete without plenty of delicious onion flavor (<i>Sorry people with onion allergies!</i>). For this recipe we are going to peel and halve a whole yellow onion to brown and flavor the broth. Then I like to use pearl onions for the stew portion. Pearl onions work so wonderfully in stews! They absorb, and output, a lot of flavor without going overboard. And they are just really pleasant to munch on when they are not overcooked. You could go with pretty much any onion you wanted, but I feel like it's pretty much impossible to get regular onions to stay in nice chucks as opposed to seperating into their component layers. And when they do that they all but disolve into the stew. I like my stews to be nice and hearty, so pearl onion are the way to go!</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Celery</h4>
            <p> Celery is another requisite veggie in a great beef stew. But unlike many stews you may have had, we are not going to be cutting our celery up and adding it to the stew to eat. We are just going to trim whole stalks, and add them in the beginning to add flavor. We're doing this for two reasons:
              <ol>
                <li>It's impossible to get chunks of celery to <strong>NOT</strong> overcook when stewing. At least if you want them to actually add any flavor.</li>
                <li>Celery is pretty much always slightly unpleasant to eat. You really can't fully get rid of the stringy bits that get caught in yout teeth.</li>
              </ol>
            Leaving the celery in whole stalk allows us to easily pluck them out when we are ready to do so. So we get all the flavor, and none of the unpleasantness.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Potato</h4>
            <p> I fully agree with Kenji on this point. Gold potatoes are the way to go. While I don't agree with his lack of flour, potato starch really does mute flavor quite a lot. At the end of the day, go with your favorite. But I do <strong>really</strong> recommend sticking with a lower starch potato. </p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Mushroom</h4>
            <p> This is one of the more devisive "classic" ingredients. Personally, I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and will always include them. They provide (<i>And more importantly, <strong>absorb</strong></i>) a ton of flavor. I like using button mushrooms, but you can't go wrong. We will brown these, then remove them to add later.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Garlic</h4>
            <p> We will leave our cloves whole but peeled. Notice if you read Kenji's recipe, he leaves his unpeeled. I cannot fathom why. The peels don't impart more flavor, brown poorly, and have chance of slipping off to add an unpleasant surprise to the stew. We will peel all of our veggies in this recipe. Nothing alse to say for this. It's garlic.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Peas</h4>
            <p>A divisive ingredient for beed stew indeed. There's no need to include peas, but they do add a nice pop of color. Just throw some frozen peas in right at the end if you want to use any.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Corn</h4>
          <p>Another devisive ingredient. I don't use corn in my stew, but feel free. Similar to my advice for peas, just throw in some frozen corn at the end. These also add a nice pop of color to the stew.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Green Beans</h4>
        <p>The final devisive and optional ingredient I will cover. I'm personally a fan of green beans in my beef stew, but I rarely find myself using them for some reason. Get fresh beans, trim the ends, and cut them into halves or thirds. The pieces should fit nicely on a spoon. Toss this in the last 5-6 minutes of cooking and they will turn out nicely.</p></li>
        </ul>
      <li><h3>Flavors and other ingredients</h3></li>
        <ul>
        <li><h4>Stock</h4>
          <p> Years ago, when I first read Kenji's recipe, I could not beleive his claims about beef stock. The first thing I did was head to the store and confirm it for myself. I have been a chicken stock kind of guy since. Of course, a homemade stock will always be the best choice! But, it's hard to keep good homemade stock on hand outside of a restaurant, unless you are making soups and stews constantly. It's way to much work for me to make a good stock unless I already have a bunch of leftover parts to use. Just try to find a stock with a good flavor and no, or as little, salt as you can. And if you are going to use store-bought, grab a chicken stock with the fewest ingredients you can find. The stock can make a huge impact, so this one of the ingredients that's worth spending a bit extra on.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Acid (maybe booze)</h4>
          <p> This is a big point for a lot of people. Kenji recommends a cheapish red wine, sherry, or vermouth. I'll be honest; I have never tried sherry or vermouth in a beef stew. But I can echo Kenji's sentiment about the benefits of red wine. It really does add complexity to the flavor of the stew you can't find anywhere else. If you don't want to use alcohol, or just don't have any, you can stick with vinegar mixed with a little water. Since we are browning all this meat and veggiers, we need some acid to deglaze the frond from the bottom of the pot so we can absorb all of that delicious flavor. If you go with wine, just stick with any moderately priced red wine. I would stick to something that has <i>a little</i> sugar. If you are spending more than $15 - $20 on your wine, you are overspending. Unless you just want to drink the rest while you cook! If you are going with vinegar and water, I would go with balsamic vinegar to try to get a little complexity out of it. Red wine or apple cidar vinegar would be my next choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Flavorings</h4>
          <p> This is what Kenji calls umami-bombs, and it is a great concept that is well known in pretty much every quality restaurant. Kenji uses anchovies, which is not something I agree  with using. Don't get me wrong, they add a lot of great umami, but they also add a grittiness that can be a pain to deal with. Kenji throws all of his umami bombs in a food processor, but if you skip the anchovies that step is not necessary. Generally, the more the merrier for a long cooking stew. We want to use at leats three of these. Using more umamu-bombs gives us a layered, more complex flavor. Using multiple also allows us to use less of any one ingredient. This is important because all of these umamu-bombs have very strong flavors, and we don't want these to override the main flavors of the dish. Some bombs you should use are:
            <ul>
              <li>Tomato paste. Just make sure you brown it nicely.</li>
              <li>Worchestershire sauce. The stronger the better. Just try to find one with more flavor and less sodium.</li>
              <li>Soy sauce. Again, the strong the better. Just stick with a good soy without much sugar.</li>
              <li>Fish sauce. Fish sauce adds an amazing flavor to pretty much anything. I especially recommend grabbing some if you are skipping the anchovies.</li>
              <li>MSG. If you are using a good brand of soy or fish sauce, this may not be necessary, but if your soy uses sodium and you are not using fish sauce, then definitely throw some MSG into your stew.</li>
              <li>Parmigiano-Reggiano. Yes, cheese. Parmesan can be a great way to add umami to a dish. I don't personally recommend using this in beef stew, but you <strong>could</strong>. If you do try it out, just stick with a decent block of younger cheese you have grate yourself. Stay far away from American "Parmesan"!</li>
              <li>Anchovies. As discussed above, I stay away from this. But Kenji does use it to great effect. If you feel like using this, just throw it in a food processor with all of your other umami bombs and make sure the anchovies are very well processed.</li>
            </ul></p></li>
      <li><h3>Herbs</h3>
        <p>There are a host of herbs you can throw into beef stew. But we have so much flavor already that we don't need to go too crazy. I like to stic with bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary. We will use whole sprigs of thyme and rosemary for flavor in the beginning,  so no need to dress them. </p></li>
      <li><h3>Thickener</h3></li>
            <p> This is one area where I disagree with Kenji. Kenji uses gelatin to thicken his stew, but personally, I don't like this method. Using solely gelatin leaves the broth <strong>too</strong> clear and firm. It makes the stew feel like it came out of a can and not from all of your hard work. In my experience, flour doesn't deaden flavors as much as the starch from potatoes or pasta does, when given adequate time to cook. Just make a quick roux when you are done browning your ingredients, but before you deglaze the pan. This will give you plenty of time cook out the "raw" flavor of the flour. Some recipes call for coating the meat in flour before browning, but this won't work since we are browning the meat in steaks and not in cubes. Plus, browning the meat while covered in flour will brown the flour, not the meat and deprive us of that delicious frond from well browned meat. Just make sure your not using too much roux! We will give the roux plenty of time to thicken the stew as we cook. You could also try using toasted flour and wisking it into the broth after you remove first batch of veg, but before the second. I haven't tried this method yet, so i can't give you any advice on the taste or texture.</p>
      <li><h3>Vessel</h3></li>
            <p> This is not an ingredient per se, but it <strong>is</strong> really important to the outcome of our dish, so it's worth spending some time on. Because we are doing so much browning, it's vital that we use a vessel with a wide bottom. A cast iron or enameled dutch oven works wonderfully, but if you don't have one, stick with a rondeau or brazing pan. We need a pot that is tall enough to hold everything, but wide enough to allow steam to escape from our browning ingredients without going <strong>through</strong> them. We want to brown out meat and veg, without cooking them. If you try to use a pasta pot or a stock pot, all of your ingredient will steam before they brown. This will result in very overcooked ingredients at the end.</p>
      <li><h3>Time</h3>
        <p>The most important ingredient! I see a lot of people trying to stew their beef for hours and hours thinking this will make the meat more tender. But this thought couldn't be further from the truth! Every cut of beef has its own timeframe for how long it should be cooked depending on how tough the meat, the type of fat, and the amount of fat and connective tissue it has. This time can range from anywhere between a few minutes and 2 1/2 hours. This recipe is going to use chuck roast, so we will cook our meat for that full 2 1/2 hours or so. Like wise, we want to be careful of when we put out veggies in. If youcut them larger or smaller than I do, it will affect the cooking time. Just adjust as necessary.</p></li>
