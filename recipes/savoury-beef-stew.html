  <h1>Savoury Beef Stew</h1>
    <p> There are few things better during a cold winter than hearty and rich beef stew! My recipe borrows heavily from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's famous recipe, though I <strong>do</strong> disagree with a few of Kenji's conclusion and my recipe differs as a result. You can find Kenji's recipe <a href ="https://www.seriouseats.com/all-american-beef-stew-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here!</a> I highly recommend giving it a read. Kenji is a great resource for recipes general food knowledge. This recipe can be a little labor intensive (<em>no throwing pre-packaged stew meat into a crock pot here!</em>) but it is well worth the effort. You will absolutely taste the difference that effort makes.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredient Notes</h2>
      <li><h3>Beef</h3>
        <p> Good beef choice is the most important and most often overlooked part of making stew. A surprising number of people just grab whatever is handy or cheapest and throw it into a pot. But this beef stew relies heavily on the beef flavor, so we need to show a little more care in our beef choice. As Kenji mentions, stay away from those pakcages of "stew meat" at the grocery store! Those are usually just the off cuts and scraps from other cuts and you can never be sure what your getting, or even that your getting the same cuts in one package. There are a few things we're looking for when thinking about what cut of beef to use.
          <ol>
            <li>We want a strong beefy flavor</li>
            <li>We want a lot of connective tissue, tougher fat, and a lot of collagen</li>
            <li>We want large steaks or a large hunk of beef we can cut into steaks</li>
          </ol>

          Stay away from actual cuts of steak! They are too tender and the softer fat renders too quickly (which is great when your making steak!), but will result in tough chewy meat in a stew. We need tougher meat with high collagen content and plenty of fat. Bones are a bonus as they add a ton of flavor, but are not needed. We want to stick with:
          <ul>
            <li>Chuck</li>
            <li>Bone-in short rib</li>
            <li>Bohemian (bottom sirloin flap)</li>
            <li>Oxtail</li>
            <li>Second-cut brisket (The fatty end)</li>
            <li>Cross-cut shanks (like for osso buco)</li>
            </ul>

          Your final choice is going to depend on your budget and availablilty of a good butcher. Some of those cuts are hard to find and may have to be special ordered, but you should be able to find a good chuck roast anywhere. We want to use or cut our beef into about 2"-2 1/2" steaks. This will allow us to get really good browning on as much meat as possible, while keeping the amount of meat that actually gets cooked while do doing so. We want out meat to cook in the oven, not on the stove! After browning we are going to cut the meet into 1 1/2" - 2" cubes to go into the stew</p></li>
