  <h1>Savoury Beef Stew</h1>
    <p> There are few things better during a cold winter than hearty and rich beef stew! My recipe borrows heavily from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's famous recipe, though I <strong>do</strong> disagree with a few of Kenji's conclusion and my recipe differs as a result. You can find Kenji's recipe <a href ="https://www.seriouseats.com/all-american-beef-stew-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here!</a> I highly recommend giving it a read. Kenji is a great resource for recipes general food knowledge. This recipe can be a little labor intensive (<em>no throwing pre-packaged stew meat into a crock pot here!</em>) but it is well worth the effort. You will absolutely taste the difference that effort makes.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li><h3>Beef</h3>
        <p> Good beef choice is the most important and most often overlooked part of making stew. A surprising numbe rof people just grab whatever is handy or cheapest and throw it into a pot. But this beef stew relies heavily on the beed flavor so we need to show a little more care in our beef choice. As Kenji mentions, stay away from those pakcages of "stew meat" at the grocery store! Those are usually just the off cuts and scraps from other cuts and you can never be sure what your getting, or even that your getting the same cuts in one package. There are a few things we're looking for whne thinking baout what cut of beef to use.
          <ol>
            <li>We want a strong beefy flavor</li>
            <li>We want a lot of connective tissue and tougher fat</li>
            <li>We want large steaks or a large hunk of beef we can cut into steaks</li>
          </ol>
          Stay away from actual cuts of steak! They are too tender and the softer fat renders too quickly, which is great when your making steak! But will result in tough chewy meat in a stew.
