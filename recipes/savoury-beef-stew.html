  <h1>Savoury Beef Stew</h1>
    <p>There are few things better during a cold winter than hearty and rich beef stew! My recipe borrows from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's famous recipe, though I <strong>do</strong> disagree with a few of Kenji's conclusion and my recipe differs as a result. You can find Kenji's recipe <a href ="https://www.seriouseats.com/all-american-beef-stew-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here!</a> I highly recommend giving it a read. Kenji is a great resource for recipes general food knowledge.</p>
