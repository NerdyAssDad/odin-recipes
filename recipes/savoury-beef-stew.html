  <h1>Savoury Beef Stew</h1>
    <p> There are few things better during a cold winter than hearty and rich beef stew! My recipe borrows heavily from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's famous recipe, though I <strong>do</strong> disagree with a few of Kenji's conclusions and my recipe differs as a result. You can find Kenji's recipe <a href ="https://www.seriouseats.com/all-american-beef-stew-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here!</a> I highly recommend giving it a read. Kenji is a great resource for recipes and general food knowledge. This recipe can be a little labor intensive (<em>no throwing pre-packaged stew meat into a crock pot here!</em>) but it is well worth the effort. You will absolutely taste the difference that effort makes.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredient Notes</h2>
      <li><h3>Beef</h3>
        <p> Good beef choice is the most important and most often overlooked part of making stew. A surprising number of people just grab whatever is handy or cheapest and throw it into a pot. But this beef stew relies heavily on the beef flavor, so we need to show a little more care in our beef choice. As Kenji mentions, stay away from those pakcages of "stew meat" at the grocery store! Those are usually just the off cuts and scraps from other cuts and you can never be sure what your getting, or even that your getting the same cuts in one package. There are a few things we're looking for when thinking about what cut of beef to use.
          <ol>
            <li>We want a strong beefy flavor</li>
            <li>We want a lot of connective tissue, tougher fat, and a lot of collagen</li>
            <li>We want large steaks or a large hunk of beef we can cut into steaks</li>
          </ol>

          Stay away from actual cuts of steak! They are too tender and the softer fat renders too quickly (which is great when your making steak!), but will result in tough chewy meat in a stew. We need tougher meat with high collagen content and plenty of fat. Bones are a bonus as they add a ton of flavor, but are not needed. We want to stick with:
          <ul>
            <li>Chuck</li>
            <li>Bone-in short rib</li>
            <li>Bohemian (bottom sirloin flap)</li>
            <li>Oxtail</li>
            <li>Second-cut brisket (The fatty end)</li>
            <li>Cross-cut shanks (like for osso buco)</li>
            </ul>

          Your final choice is going to depend on your budget and availablilty of a good butcher. Some of those cuts are hard to find and may have to be specially ordered, but you should be able to find a good chuck roast anywhere. We want to use ,or cut, our beef into about 2"-2 1/2" steaks. This will allow us to get really good browning on as much meat as possible, while keeping the amount of meat that actually gets cooked while do doing so to a minimum. We want our meat to cook in the oven, not on the stove! After browning we are going to cut the meet into 1 1/2" - 2" cubes to go into the stew</p></li>
      <li><h3>Vegetables</h3>
       <p>  We are going to seperate our veggies into two batches. Whole, or mostly whole, for flavoring the broth and nice fork size pieces to go in during the last hour or so of cooking. This allows us to get all the flavor for stewing the veggiers for a long time, while still retaining nice forkfuls of deliciousness. We are going to brown most of our veggies, which will give us a ton of flavor, but this will effect how the veggies cook. Also, browning effectively requires the veggies to be quite dry. So veggies that hold a lot of moisture will need some special preparation if you're going to go with one. I'm only going to cover the classic options, but I've seen people use things like eggplant, zucchini, or squash in beef stew. Just keep in mind the above rules when making your decision. Generally, go for larger veggies that can be cut down. The actual veggies we can use is variable and up for debate, but here are the classics:
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Carrots</h4>
            <p> Carrots are a given with beef stew. The only point I have here is; <strong>DO NOT USE BABY CARROTS</strong>. Baby carrots are just the centers of full size carrots with the outside portions shaved away. Baby carrots produce <strong>way</strong> to much moisture to brown effectively. We will use standard large, unpeeled carrots you can find at the grocery store. It's important to get the unpeeled carrots, as the skin keeps the insides from absorbing all the moisture that gets sprayed on the produce at the grocery store.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Onion</h4>
            <p> A beef stew is not complete without plenty of delicious onion flavor (<i>Sorry people with onion allergies!</i>). For this recipe we are going to quarter a whole yellow onion to brown and flavor the broth. Then I like to use pearl onions for stew portion. Pearl onions work so wonderfully in stews! They absorb, and output, a lot of flavor without going overboard. And they are just really pleasant to munch on when they are not overcooked. You could go with pretty much any onion you wanted, but I feel like it's pretty much impossible to get regular onions to stay in nice chucks as opposed to seperating into their component layers. And when they do that they all but disolve into the stew. I like my stews to be nice and hearty, so pearl onion are the wyay to go!</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Celery</h4>
            <p> Celery is another requisite veggie in a great beef stew. But unlike many stews you may have had, we are not going to be cutting our celery up and adding it to the stew to eat. We are just going to trim whole stalks, and add them in the beginning to add flavor. We're doing this for two reasons:
              <ol>
                <li>It's impossible to get chunks of celery to <strong>NOT</strong> overcook when stewing. At least if you want them to actually add any flavor.</li>
                <li>Celery is pretty much always slightly unpleasant to eat. You really can't fully get rid of the stringy bits that get caught in yout teeth.</li>
              </ol>
            Leaving the celery in whole stalk allows us to easily pluck them out when we are ready to do so. So we get all the flavor, and none of the unpleasantness.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Potato</h4>
            <p>I fully agree with Kenji on this point. Gold potatoes are the way to go. While I don't agree with his lack of flour, potato starch really does mute flavor quite a lot. At the end of the day, go with your favorite. But I do <strong>really</strong> recommend sticking with a lower starch potato. </p></li>
