  <h1>Amazing Grilled Cheese</h1>

  <p>There are few things I love more than a delicious and decadent grilled cheese. Whether you're going for a plain hit of nostalgia and classing it up with something fancy, there are few dishes as universally loved as a good grilled cheese. The secret to making a truly great grilled cheese is all in the ingredients! This recipe will be structured a little differently since ingredient choice matters so much.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Bread</h3>
      <p>There are basically two different approaches to grilled cheese and they are defined by bread choice. Some like a drier more toasted grilled cheese, and others, like myself, prefer frying their grilled cheese in a good amount of butter and oil. If you are making a drier toasted or grilled sandwhich then you should stick with a thinner slice, about 1/2" or so, of firmer crusty bread with a looser crumb, like italian or sourdough. But if you like a great fried grilled cheese then you should go with a thicker slice of denser and softer bread. Think traditional white bread or texas toast. If you are relegated to grocery store bread, I really like <em>Nature's Own Perfectly Crafted Thick Sliced Bread</em>. You want something dense and soft to soak up the butter and oil. Healthy? No. But you're eating grilled cheese, so let's not kid ourselves about what we want. Whichever approach you go with, make sure to use the best bread you can get! There are only a few ingredients in a grilled cheese, so your choice makes a huge difference in the final product!</p>
    <h3>Cheese</h3>
      <p>Being the second of 3-4 ingredients, your choice of cheese also makes a <strong>huge</strong> difference in the quality of your sandwhich. There are thouasands of different kinds of cheeses throught the world. Luckily, we only need to focus on a few here in the US. You can certainly stick with just one kind, but I've found that mixing 2-3 different types of cheese gives a better final product. I usually like to mix strong tasting cheese, with milder cheese that melt better. Generally, you want 3-4 slices per sandwhich for standard sized bread. Feel free to add more if you are using a larger loaf like sourdough! You want some volume without the cheese all dripping down the sides. </p>
        <h4>American</h4>
          <p>The classic. Most people start looking down on American cheese once they start tasting other kinds, but this honestly comes from a place of ignorance. People say American cheese is basically plastic, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Most American cheese is simply a very mild cheddar that has been melted into cream and emulsifiers to make an extra thick sauce, then cooled to solidify it for slicing. You can even make it at home! This is why American cheese melts so well. American is a phenomenal choice for grilled cheese! There is a reason it's a classic. If you <strong>do</strong> go with American, make sure to get a better brand sliced from a deli or butcher. Most fresh American is much better than the kind that comes in inividually wrapped singles. That stuff might <strong>actually</strong>be close to being plastic. You certainly don't need all those preservatives!</p>
        <h4>Cheddar</h4>
          <p>You may ahve noticed I didn't lump American in with this category, despite American cheese being made form cheddar. This is partially because of misinformation around American cheese, but maily because there is a wide breadth of cheddars around and American is generally only made from mild. Most cheddars tend to melt well, but a strong aged cheddar should be paired with a well melting cheese like American or Gruyere. Either choice works, just keep your final composition and the flavor of your bread in mind. Cheddars can vary so wildly that it's difficult to give anything but general advice. Smoky cheddars can pair very well if you actually grilling your sandwhich over open flame, but I would also recommend something sharp and soemthing rich if you go that route. A good swiss can cover both roles well.</p>
