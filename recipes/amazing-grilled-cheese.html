  <h1>Amazing Grilled Cheese</h1>
  <img src="../images/amazing-grilled-cheese.jpg" alt="A picture of two halves of a grilled cheese with gooey cheese dripping down" height="1280" width="1280">
  <p> There are few things I love more than a delicious and decadent grilled cheese. Whether you're going for a plain hit of nostalgia and classing it up with something fancy, there are few dishes as universally loved as a good grilled cheese. The secret to making a truly great grilled cheese is all in the ingredients! This recipe will be structured a little differently since ingredient choice matters so much.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><h3>Bread</h3>
      <p> There are basically two different approaches to grilled cheese and they are defined by bread choice. Some like a drier more toasted grilled cheese, and others, like myself, prefer frying their grilled cheese in a good amount of butter and oil. If you are making a drier toasted or grilled sandwhich then you should stick with a thinner slice, about 1/2" or so, of firmer crusty bread with a looser crumb, like italian or sourdough. But if you like a great fried grilled cheese then you should go with a thicker slice of denser and softer bread. Think traditional white bread or texas toast. If you are relegated to grocery store bread, I really like <em>Nature's Own Perfectly Crafted Thick Sliced Bread</em>. You want something dense and soft to soak up the butter and oil. Healthy? No. But you're eating grilled cheese, so let's not kid ourselves about what we want. Whichever approach you go with, make sure to use the best bread you can get! There are only a few ingredients in a grilled cheese, so your choice makes a huge difference in the final product!</p></li>
    <li><h3>Cheese</h3>
      <p> Being the second of 3-4 ingredients, your choice of cheese also makes a <strong>huge</strong> difference in the quality of your sandwhich. There are thouasands of different kinds of cheeses throught the world. Luckily, we only need to focus on a few here in the US. You can certainly stick with just one kind, but I've found that mixing 2-3 different types of cheese gives a better final product. I usually like to mix strong tasting cheese, with milder cheese that melt better, then something to add richness. Some cheeses can fill more than one of these roles, but I always use at least two different cheeses, and often more. Generally, you want 3-4 slices per sandwhich for standard sized bread. Feel free to add more if you are using a larger loaf like sourdough! You want some volume without the cheese all dripping down the sides. </p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><h4>American</h4>
          <p> The classic. Most people start looking down on American cheese once they start tasting other kinds, but this honestly comes from a place of ignorance. People say American cheese is basically plastic, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Most American cheese is simply a very mild cheddar that has been melted into cream and emulsifiers to make an extra thick sauce, then cooled to solidify it for slicing. You can even make it at home! This is why American cheese melts so well. American is a phenomenal choice for grilled cheese! There is a reason it's a classic. If you <strong>do</strong> go with American, make sure to get a better brand sliced from a deli or butcher. Most fresh American is much better than the kind that comes in inividually wrapped singles. That stuff might <strong>actually</strong>be close to being plastic. You certainly don't need all those preservatives!</p></li>
        <li><h4>Cheddar</h4>
          <p> You may ahve noticed I didn't lump American in with this category, despite American cheese being made from cheddar. This is partially because of misinformation around American cheese, but mainly because there is a wide breadth of cheddars around and American is generally only made from mild. Most cheddars tend to melt well, but a strong aged cheddar should be paired with a well melting cheese like American or Gruyère. Either choice works, just keep your final composition and the flavor of your bread in mind. Cheddars can vary so wildly that it's difficult to give anything but general advice. Smoky cheddars can pair very well if you are actually grilling your sandwhich over open flame, but I would also recommend something sharp and soemthing rich if you go that route. A good swiss can cover both roles well.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Provolone</h4>
          <p> Provolone works wonderfully for grilled cheese. Get an extra smokey cheese to add some flavor, but milder provolones melt very well and can fill that role if needed.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Swiss</h4>
          <p> Swiss doesn't melt the best, but it does add richness and a sharp flavor note that can make it a great pair for most cheeses. A good strong swiss is one of my go to's for grilles cheese.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Gruyère</h4>
          <p> Gruyère is another great melter and can add some good richness to your composition. Stick to younger cheeses, as Gruyère can get grainy as it melt after it ages for awhile. Younger Gruyère's tend to have a milder flavor that is notably earthy, so they pair well with aged cheddars. Be careful with using a Gruyère with a strong aged swiss, as the sandwhich can get quite rich.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Havarti</h4>
          <p> Yet one more rich melter. Havarti has a mild flavor and is a great pair for stronger cheeses. Like swiss, be careful before pairing with other rich cheeses.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Montery Jack</h4>
          <p> As well as derivatives like pepperjack, cheddarjack, and colbyjack. Great melters with mild flavors. Pair with flavorful and raich cheeses to get the most out of it. Colbyjack tends to be richer than the other jack cheeses. They all tend to be a little sweet, so keep that in mind!</p></li>
        <li><h4>Parmigiano Reggiano</h4>
          <p> Parmesan has a great flavor and savouriness, but doesn't melt well unless young. Stick to younger, softer cheeses and bear the saltiness in mind. I prefer to grate my parmesan and feather it between two other slices. Freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano is one of my favorite cheeses and it's a personal go to for "fancier" grilled cheeses.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Mozzarella</h4>
          <p> I'm personally not a huge fan of mozzarella on grilled cheeses, but I know plenty of people who are. Mozarella is a phenomenal melter. Just stick to a low moisture cheese and pair it with strong flavors.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Others</h4>
          <p> There a multitude of cheeses you can try, but the above are probably the most common. Don't be afraid to experiment! Just keep the triangle of meltiness, richness, and flavor in mind when selecting cheeses. And go nuts! Try out different cheese combinations with different breads, and don't be afraid to try jam or preserves! One of my personal favorites is Brie with cranberry preserves.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <li><h3>Butter</h3>
       <p>  I'm usually a fan of higher fat content European-style butters, but for grilled cheeses that is the opposite of when we want. Butters with less fat and more milk solids will give us a much better browning and result in a better crust. A great grilled cheese should have a solid crunchy, browned crust on the outside, but retain it's soft inside. This is why I prefer using thicker soft bread. If you are going for a toasted or grilled approach, stick to a higher fat content butter, or skip it entirely! Just lightly oil the bread with a high smoke point oil and your all set.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Oil</h3>
        <p> Stick to a low flavor oil with a high smoke point, like canola. Stay away from the olive oil! For the most part. It <em>can</em> work with a lower heat and with the right cheeses.</p></li>
